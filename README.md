This is a Python implementation of an interpreter for Lox, a simple scripting language. It's inspired by jlox, a Java implementation created in the step-by-step book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html) by Robert Nystrom.

# Base Stage:
1. Ensure you have `python (3.12)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
3. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

This stage involves building a scanner for the Lox interpreter. It will scan through source code and group tokens such as keywords, operators, punctuation, whitespace, and literals (strings, numbers).

This stage is thoroughly explained in: Chapter 4
