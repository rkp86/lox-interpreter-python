# Lox Interpreter 

### Under development
This is a Python implementation of an interpreter for Lox, a simple scripting language. It's inspired by jlox, a Java implementation created in the step-by-step book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html) by Robert Nystrom.

## Requirements:
Ensure you have `python (3.12)` installed locally

## Base Stage:

This stage involves building a scanner for the Lox interpreter. It will scan through source code and group tokens such as keywords, operators, punctuation, whitespace, and literals (strings, numbers).

This stage is thoroughly explained in: Chapter 4
[Scanning](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html).
